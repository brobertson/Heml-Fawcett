The contents of this README file are also located as a header in terminus.patch.

This patch sets up Jena to automatically generate terminus post quem and
termuins ante quem tags for subjects tagged with simple dates as inserted into a
graph. This feature can be enabled and dissabled by calling
terminusInsertion( boolen enabled ) on your graph object. 

Note that this feature depends on your graph being an extension of the
GraphBase object, which is true for all graphs already in Jena.

Note also that this depends on an external jar file which handles the parsing of
these dates (cocoon-heml-block.jar) which must be placed in Jena's lib
directory.

Instructions to apply this patch:
  * Copy cocoon-heml-block.jar into Jena's lib directory
  * Copy this patch file into Jena's src directory
  * cd into Jena's src directory
  * run 'patch -p1 -i terminus.patch
  * cd into Jena's root directory and build jena (run 'ant')

Jena.jar will now be in Jena's lib folder.
