-- The following README is also located at the start of timeBounds.patch --

This patch sets up Jena to automatically generate earliest time and latest time
properties for hemlRdf:SimpleDate, hemlRDF:DateRange, hemlRDF:TerminusAnteQuem
and hemlRDF:TerminusPostQuem properties as they are inserted into a graph. This
feature can be enabled and dissabled by calling timeBoundsGeneration( boolean
enabled ) on your graph object. The default enabledness can be set in
com.hp.hpl.jena.HemlConstants.

Note that this feature depends on your graph being an extension of the
GraphBase object, which is true for all graphs already in Jena.

Note also that this depends on an external jar file which handles the parsing of
these dates (cocoon-heml-block.jar) which must be placed in Jena's lib
directory.

Instructions to apply this patch:
  * Copy cocoon-heml-block.jar into Jena's lib directory
  * Copy this patch file into Jena's src directory
  * cd into Jena's src directory
  * run 'patch -p1 -i timeBounds.patch
  * Remove the patch file
  * cd into Jena's root directory and build jena (run 'ant')

The new Jena jar file will now be in Jena's lib folder.
