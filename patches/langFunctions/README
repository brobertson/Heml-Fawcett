This patch extends ARQ to support language matching in specialized queries. The
functions are useful when a desired resource is available in multiple languages.

The functions take a string of language codes as one of their arguments, which
is then used for matching throughout the query's execution. Languages not found
on this list can first be filtered out of the result set. Matching resources can
then be ordered based on their language's position in the language tags string.

To include these functions in a query, add 
'PREFIX myPrefix: <java:org.heml.sparql.>' to the prefixes at the start of the
query.

An example of typical usage:
PREFIX rdfs:      <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX langPrefs: <java:org.heml.sparql.>
PREFIX :          <http://example.com/ns#>
SELECT ?label WHERE{
   :event1 rdfs:label ?label .
   FILTER ( langPrefs:LangPrefsFilter ( ?label, "eng;en, fre/fra-ca;fr-ca" ) )
}ORDER BY ( langPrefs:LangPrefsOrder ( ?label, "eng;en, fre/fra-ca;fr-ca" ) )
LIMIT 1

Note that languages in the preferences list can contain language extensions
(e.g. en-us). A language preference with no extension will match *any* language
with the same base, regarless of the dialect extension.

Javascript utility functions to build language-based queries can be found in
sparqlLangUtil.js
